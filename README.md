## 👋 Hello! I'm Tarun

I am an engineer from Kochi, India 🌴 
Currently based in San Francisco, California 🌉

I studied Production Engineering at NIT Calicut, India, and did my grad school in Mechanical Engineering at Northeastern University, Boston.
While in grad school, I got interested in working on robotics, and then went on to become a software engineer.

I currently work as a [UI Frameworks engineer](https://www.apple.com/macos/) at Apple. 

I'm interested in writing code involving robotics, graphics, math and designing for hardware, among other things. 
I am an avid history buff, and in my spare time take nightscape photos, and enjoy astronomy.
