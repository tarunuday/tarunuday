## 👋 Hello! I'm Tarun

I am an engineer from 🌴 Kochi, India, currently based in 🌉 San Francisco, California.

I studied Production Engineering at NIT Calicut, India, and did my grad school in Mechanical Engineering at Northeastern University, Boston.
While in grad school, I got interested in working on robotics, and then went on to become a software engineer.

I currently work as an [UI Frameworks engineer](https://www.apple.com/macos/) at 🍎 Apple. 

I'm interested in writing code involving robotics, graphics, math and designing for hardware, among other things. 
I am an avid history buff, and in my spare time take nightscape photos, and enjoy astronomy.
