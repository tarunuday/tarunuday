## 👋 Hello! I'm Tarun

### I'm an engineer from 🌴 Kochi, India, currently based in 🌉 San Francisco, California

### I did my grad school in Mechanical Engineering at Northeastern.

### I currently work as an [OS engineer](https://www.apple.com/macos/) at 🍎 Apple. 

### I'm interested in writing code involving robotics, graphics, math and designing for hardware, among other things. 
### My experience includes building experiments and writing code to solve problems in computer vision, and sensor fusion, typically using C++ and Python.

### My (short) career has taken a winding path - I've been lucky enough to work with some amazing people on projects involving aerospace materials, soft robots, autonomous vehicles and data science. 
### I'm an avid history buff, and in my spare time take nightscape photos, and enjoy astronomy.
